Stellar Mammals is an act of creative bravery spanning music, visual art and philosophy. The musical and philosophical intention is to bring good vibes into work and creative life in a disruptive manner while hopefully cultivating flow and focus. 

It was originally conceived and largely created by [Mark Koester](http://markwk.com).
